# SnapCycle

## Won Best Environmental Hack at MacHacks 3!

## Overview
SnapCycle is a web app where the user can scan an item to receive info on its recyclability and how to dispose of it! Say no more to scientific articles going into detail on things you don't need to know, SnapCycle tells you exactly what you need to do on the spot!

### Structure and Flow
src holds the files for the web app developed with React. This includes all the different webpages featured. yolov7 contains all the back-end features of the project, with most of the files being used to train the object detection model. main.py is what is used to recieve info from the user when they take a picture, and send the image to the object detection model to scan and return a value back that the webpage can use to correctly navigate to its next page.
